# Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard built using the Open Weather Map API, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

## Description
A simple, mobile-friendly weather app!

This application uses two different API calls, both endpoints of the Open Weather Map API:

1. Current weather by city name:
   1. https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
1. And the One Call API endpoint (by latitude and longitude):
   1. https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={API key}
    
On user search, these API calls allow the application to dynamically generate:

* The current weather conditions for the searched city, including:
  * Icons corresponding to the current conditions
  * Temperature
  * Feels like
  * Humidity
  * Wind speed, and
  * UV index
  
* A five-day forecast for the searched city including:
  * Dates
  * Icons corresponding to the daily weather conditions
  * Temperature, and
  * Humidity

* A search history, built using local storage, appended via link buttons to the basic HTML

When the page is reloaded, local storage will persist and will automatically generate the current conditions and five-day forecast for the most recent searched city.
Additionally, the UV index is displayed with different colors to indicate the index as being favorable (less than 3), moderate (between 3 and 7), or severe (8 or above).

The application is built using Bootstrap (v. 4.5): https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css, 
and jQuery (v. 3.5): https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js.

This application is hosted by GitHub pages and is deployed at https://eliaswolfgang.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/.
